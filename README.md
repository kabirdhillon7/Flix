# Flix
Flix is an iOS app that allows users to browse movies from [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#). 

Flix is designed using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, which separates the app's data model, user interface, and business logic into distinct components.

## Testing

In order to test the functionality of this project, I have set up test cases for the `ViewModels`. The test cases check if the `ViewModels` are able to retrieve the data and handle the data correctly.

To run the tests, open the project in Xcode, then go to the `Product` menu and select `Test` or use the `âŒ˜ + U` keyboard shortcut.

### Test Dependencies
The tests use the following dependencies:

- [XCTest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest): A framework provided by Apple that allows us to write tests for our iOS code.
- [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine): A framework provided by Apple for handling asynchronous code.

### Test Files
There are two test files in the project:

#### MoviesViewModelTests

This file contains tests for the `MoviesViewModel`. The tests check if the `ViewModel` is able to retrieve movie data correctly and if the `ViewModel` is correctly handling the data.

#### MoviesGridTests

This file contains tests for the `MoviesGridViewModel`. The tests check if the `ViewModel` is able to retrieve superhero movie data correctly and if the `ViewModel` is correctly handling the data.
